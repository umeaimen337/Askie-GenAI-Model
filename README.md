Askie - AI-Powered Resume Assistant
Askie is a Generative AI (GenAI) system that helps answer questions about resumes using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It reads resume files, breaks them into meaningful chunks, and stores them in a Qdrant vector database. When you ask a question, Askie searches for relevant resume details and provides accurate responses.

Features:
a. AI-Powered Resume Search – Get answers based on actual resume content.
b. Smart Chunking – Splits resumes into meaningful sections for better results.
c. Fast & Secure – Uses Qdrant for efficient search and Hugging Face embeddings for accuracy.
d. Easy Integration – Works with text files and retrieves answers in seconds.

How It Works:
1 Upload a resume (text file).
2️ Ask a question about the resume.
3️ Get an AI-generated answer based on the resume content.

If the resume doesn’t contain the answer, Askie will let you know instead of making things up!
